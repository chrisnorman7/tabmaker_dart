F                Dm       C
Hark! The herald angels sing,

Am     Bb     C       F
"Glory to the newborn King!

F                  Dm      G7
Peace on earth and mercy mild,

C                  G7   C
God and sinners recon...ciled."

Am      Bb     F       C
Joyful, all ye nations rise,

Am       Bb      F      C
Join the triumph of the skies,

Bb          Am  Gm   D7 Gm
With th'angelic host proclaim:

C          F       Bb  C F
"Christ is born in Bethlehem."

Hark! The herald angels sing,

"Glory to the new-born King!"

F                 Dm         C
Christ by highest heav'n adored,

Am         Bb   C       F
Christ the ever-lasting Lord!

F              Dm         G7
Late in time behold Him come,

C                  G7   C
Offspring of a Virgin's womb.

Am        Bb        F         C
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see,

Am         Bb      F   C
Hail the incarnate Deity,

Bb             Am   Gm  D7 Gm
Pleased as man with man to dwell,

C      F      Bb  C F
Jesus, our Em-man-u-el.

Hark the herald...

F                    Dm        C
Hail the heav'n-born Prince of Peace!

Am       Bb     C         F
Hail the Son of Righteous-ness!

F                 Dm        C
Light and life to all He brings,

C                     G7  C
Ris'n with healing in His wings.

Am      Bb       F     C
Mild He lays His glory by,

Am        Bb     F        C
Born that man no more may die,

B             Am  Gm   D7 Gm
Born to raise the sons of earth,

C       F         Bb  C   F
Born to give them sec-ond birth.

Hark the herald...
